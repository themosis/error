Themosis Error
==============

The Themosis error component provides a highly configurable PHP API to manage application errors and exceptions.
The package also provides a nice looking and color accessible interface to better help you debug your projects.

Installation
------------

Install the library using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer require themosis/error
```

Features
--------

- Configurable error reporter
- Backtrace with identifiable frames
- File preview
- HTML error report template with light and dark themes
- Configurable PHP error handler
- Configurable PHP exception handler

Introduction
------------

The package provides 2 components to help you interact with PHP errors and exceptions:

1. [Report Handler](#report-handler)
2. [Backtrace](#backtrace)

Report Handler
--------------

The `ReportHandler` is the main component of the package, it acts as the aggregate that manages how you can report your application errors and exceptions.

The `ReportHandler` class requires two dependencies:

1. A collection of reporters
2. A collection of issues

A `Reporter` is an interface that represents any PHP class that can report an `Issue`. For example a reporter can report an issue to the standard output (stdout), or report the issue in a log file, or send the issue to a third-party service, ... The choice is yours. You can register as many reporters as you want. It is also possible to configure in which context a reporter should act against the given issue.

An `Issue` is an interface that represents an error or any custom problem in your application that you want to report.

Depending on your needs, you can configure multiple report handlers withing your application. Here is a basic configuration example where we always report to the stdout:

```php
$reporters = new InMemoryReporters();
$reporters->add(
    condition: new AlwaysReport(),
    reporter: new CallbackReporter(static function (Issue $issue) {
        echo $issue->message().PHP_EOL;
    }),
);

$handler = new ReportHandler(
    reporters: $reporters,
    issues: new InMemoryIssues(),
);

// Capture an issue.
$handler->capture(ExceptionIssue::create(new Exception('Oops!')));

// Publish the captured issues.
$handler->publish();
```

Let's decompose the above example...

### Reporters

The `InMemoryReporters` class is a repository that contains all declared reporters. When you declare a reporter using the `add()` method, you must provide 2 parameters:

1. A condition
2. A reporter

#### Report Condition

The first required parameter is a report condition. The condition instance is reponsible to evaluate if the linked reporter must be evaluated or not. There are builtin conditions with the package: `AlwaysReport`, `Dont` and `CallbackCondition` but you can also build your own.

The `Dont` condition will inverse the result of the encapsulated condition:

```php
// The following reporter will never be called.
$reporters->add(
    condition: new Dont(new AlwaysReport()),
    reporter: ...
);
```

The `CallbackCondition` accepts a callback as a parameter to let you evaluate if the issue should be reported or not. The given callback has the `Issue` as an argument:

```php
// The following reporter will only report RuntimeException issues.
$reporters->add(
    condition: new CallbackCondition(static function (Issue $issue) {
        return $issue instanceof RuntimeException;
    }),
    reporter: ...
);
```

You can build your own condition class by implementing the `ReportCondition` interface. The interface exposes a `can()` method that receives an `Issue` as a parameter and must return a `boolean` value:

```php
<?php

class TerminalCondition implements ReportCondition
{
    public function can(Issue $issue): bool
    {
        return php_sapi_name() === 'cli';
    }
}
```
